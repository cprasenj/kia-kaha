    "content": "Epic work out sessions to build your strength and boost your confidence. All programs are tailored for each individual. Unlike other gyms, you dont have to buy the gears to get enrolled. They will first test and condition you with rigorous work outs and see whether you are ready for starting the main session or not. The trainers are amazing. I used to train under Nishchal. Its go hard or go home for him. Enrol to have one hell of a transformational experience.!!"

    "content": "I have been training at Kia Kaha for 2 months now. Nischal and Sunil are knowledgeable and motivating coaches and explain the simplest of queries really patiently. I have been seeing positive changes both in my body (and mindset too, can't stress this enough!).Best part: level of personal attention each learner gets, even on crowded days. The coaches themselves are passionate about the sport and it really shows. Would definitely recommend."
