          <p className="lead">
            Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art based on grappling.
            The central theme of BJJ is the efficient use of skill to control a resisting opponent and compel him to submit.
            Since itâ€™s easier to gain control on the ground rather than in a standing position,
            BJJ involves the skill to take the opponent on the ground and wrestle for a dominant control position.
