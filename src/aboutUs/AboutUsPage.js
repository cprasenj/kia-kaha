        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p className="lead">In the late 2000s, if you wanted to learn Karate or Boxing, you could easily find trainers
            to train under. But what if you wanted to learn Muay Thai or Brazilian Jiu Jitsu? What about
            MMA? It’s highly unlikely you would have found anyone to learn them from, as they were
            all, especially MMA, relatively new in India. Kia Kaha was born out of this shortcoming, in
            2010.<br/>
            It was a humble beginning, sure. But we were a group of dedicated fighters with an
            insatiable appetite for knowledge. We learnt from various fighters and started training
            vigorously. We applied the techniques we learnt, mixed them with our own, and developed
            strategies that would work effectively in our fights. Before we thought of teaching others, we
            honed ourselves with an aggressive approach. We practiced hard, we fought hard, we
            survived.<br/>
            In 2015, Nischal Kellemane (enter your credentials here; your honours and achievements)
            brought Kia Kaha MMA Academy to Bangalore. We now have more than thousand students
            training under us, many of whom have won Gold and Silver medals in National Level
            Kickboxing Competitions.<br/>
            More recently, we have opened new branches in Indiranagar and Sarjapur.
            We are the only gym in Bangalore that focuses purely on combat training, on techniques
            that work well in the ring. We believe in training the hard way, because that’s the only way to
            learn martial arts. No fancy gear and no unnecessary, distracting music in the gym. Your
            body is your combat gear and the only music you hear in the gym are of the snip of the rope
            and of the punches landing on the bag or on the trainees.
            And as for the name, it’s a Maori phrase, meaning ‘Stay Strong’!
            <br />Welcome to Kia Kaha!
